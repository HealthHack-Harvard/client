## Intro

## Our solution
CardioVasc is a mobile app created to help population to manage cardiovascular disease treatments. 
The solution count with features including the medication, exams and medical appointment management,
risk factor monitoring, the treatment donation center and a support network that the users can share
their conquests, experiences and feelings about the treatments, like a social media. Besides, 
the solution count with a chatbot integrated with the openAI GTP-4 API, that answer the user instantly for occasional doubts,
a thing that would take hours, days or months to be answered in person by a doctor.

All the solution was developed focusing on the user engagement, using a push notification system to warn users when they
need to take medication and when they have appointments, as it was registered at the platform. Other then that, we implemented
a streak system that allow users to claim NFT rewards by their frequency managing their treatments, turning the whole experience
in something more gentler to deal with, at Polygon Blockchain, where the Smart Contracts were deployed.
