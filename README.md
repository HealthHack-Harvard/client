# CardioVasc

## Introduction - The problem
Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, affecting over 30.3 million people in the region. In 2019, 2.8 million new cases of 
cardiovascular diseases were registered, and 962,309 deaths were attributed to these diagnoses. Since 
1990, most of these cases and deaths have been related to ischemic heart disease, which have, in addition, 
increased as demographic and epidemiological transitions unfold. However, stroke and peripheral artery 
disease also play a significant role in the burden of CVD throughout the region.
<br>

Several countries have started to implement policies pertaining CVD prevention. Notwithstanding, most 
countries in the region lack effective surveillance systems to identify and monitor at-risk population, as 
well as to measure or evaluate inequities. Similarly, there are significant care gaps for primary and 
secondary prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and inadequate strategies to measure quality of care 
given to patients. Moreso, only four countries within LAC currently have legislation about CVD medicines 
at affordable prices or at no cost for patients, and countries within LAC present the 
“highest non-communicable disease burden associated with physical inactivity”.

## Our solution
CardioVasc is a mobile app created to help population to manage cardiovascular disease treatments. 
The solution count with features including the medication, exams and medical appointment management,
risk factor monitoring, the treatment donation center and a support network that the users can share
their conquests, experiences and feelings about the treatments, like a social media. Besides, 
the solution count with a chatbot integrated with the openAI GTP-4 API, that answer the user instantly for occasional doubts,
a thing that would take hours, days or months to be answered in person by a doctor.
<br>

All the solution was developed focusing on the user engagement, using a push notification system to warn users when they
need to take medication and when they have appointments, as it was registered at the platform. Other then that, we implemented
a streak system that allow users to claim NFT rewards by their frequency managing their treatments, turning the whole experience
in something more gentler to deal with, at Polygon Blockchain, where the Smart Contracts were deployed.
